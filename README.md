# Advanced Regression Techniques for House Price Prediction

#### Authors: Srikanth Babu Mandru

### Summary: 

Performed pre-processing of data and feature engineering. Implemented regressors, namely Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Decision tree, Random Forest, using grid search cross-validation to predict the house prices. Evaluated models through root-mean-squared error(RMSE) and selected Random Forests regressor as best model with best cross-validation RMSE and training RMSE value of 0.375 and 0.135 respectively.

### Project Description:

**Data source :** https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data 

**Models and Approach:**

Predicted House prices using advanced regression techniques such as :

Linear Regressor,

Lasso Regressor,

Ridge Regressor,

Decision Tree Regressor,

Random Forests Regressor.

Here, these models are implemented using Grid Search cross-validation and compared different models using root-mean-squared error as metric.
